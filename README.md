so when doing the commits i never realised i was supposed to do "git add ." before typing git commit, until the 30th of april which is 
why before then there was a lack of commits and suddenly the entire program appears.

NOTE: in order to get the app to run correctly you need to visit each state first or else it wont remember the total calories for the first 
few state changes. so the app starts in the vegetables state, so go to the drink then the fruit and finally the meat state and the calories
total calories will stay constant accross all the states.

To show the menu with the list of different states click the arrow in the top left hand corner.

The app is based off the sidemenu template. It has a list of each food item in the controller.js . Each food item has a title, an image associated with it, 
and the amount of calories its worth. i just made up random values for the calories. Each food item is visible by clicking on its associated 
category in the side menu.

The total calories are displayed in each card as that was the only way i could get the total calories to dispaly correctly.
